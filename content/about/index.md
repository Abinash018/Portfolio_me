Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Lovely Professional University](https://www.lpu.in/). My interest in web-development started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started developing Web projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Node.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. 

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with [8.71 GPA aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoyObDi_uNiCjrvzOfDlwjaa7GkspXV6/view?usp=sharing).

Also I've knowledge of Flutter App Development and created some projects on that also. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them. Most important I'm a [Competitive Programmer](https://leetcode.com/Roopshree/).

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
